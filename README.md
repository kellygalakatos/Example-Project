## Biometric Authentication

I thought this one would be a fun idea to try from the list of suggestions, because I know I could download it onto my friends and family's
phones, and they would have fun trying and testing it out. It is also becoming very common to use biometrics as a form of authentication, so
I consider it a very good microservice to know. 

I watched some of the WWDC talks about it from the past and followed a tutorial on this website https://codeburst.io/biometric-authentication-using-swift-bb2a1241f2be
which was very helpful. There are so many error messages that apply to this technology, that I never would have thought of.
This is a bare bones project, authenticating based on button-click and can be integrated into any future projects!
